# vue-share-popper

This is an useful tool about social network sharing based on Vue and popper.js, you can easily create a social share popup in your project.

This project is inspired by [need-more-share2](https://github.com/revir/need-more-share2).

IMPORTANT: THIS PROJECT IS STILL WORKING IN PROGRESS, IT IS UNSTABLE NOW.

## Usage

I've used `vue-demi` to support both Vue 2 and Vue 3, if you're using Vue 2, please make sure your project has installed `@vue/composition-api`.

Then you need to install this package:

```bash
npm install vue-share-popper
# or
yarn add vue-share-popper
# or
pnpm install vue-share-popper
```

The project finally exported an API called `useSharePopup`, you can use it to create a popup in your project, see more details in the reference section.

If you want to join our developement and make this project further, note that we're using `pnpm` in this project, please be sure you've installed it globally.
